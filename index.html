Edmund doesn't currently have a website.

But here's an iframe:
<iframe src = "iframe-content.html" width = "555" height = "200"/>


<script>
  if (typeof __blaBlaBlaBlaBla !== 'undefined') {
    console.log("It's in the outer page, hooray!");
  } else {
    console.log("Nothing in the outer page mate");
  }
</script>
